<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 3</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. In this world, whose family is there without 
blemish? Who is free from sickness and grief? Who is forever happy?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. A man's descent may be discerned by his conduct, 
his country by his pronunciation of language, his friendship by his warmth and 
glow, and his capacity to eat by his body.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. Give your daughter in marriage to a good family, 
engage your son in learning, see that your enemy comes to grief, and engage your 
friends in dharma. (Krsna consciousness).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. Of a rascal and a serpent, the serpent is the 
better of the two, for he strikes only at the time he is destined to kill, while 
the former at every step.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. Therefore kings gather round themselves men of good 
families, for they never forsake them either at the beginning, the middle or the 
end.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. At the time of the pralaya (universal destruction) 
the oceans are to exceed their limits and seek to change, but a saintly man 
never changes.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Do not keep company with a fool for as we can see 
he is a two-legged beast. Like an unseen thorn he pierces the heart with his 
sharp words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. Though men be endowed with beauty and youth and 
born in noble families, yet without education they are like the palasa flower, 
which is void of sweet fragrance.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. The beauty of a cuckoo is in its notes, that of a 
woman in her unalloyed devotion to her husband, that of an ugly person in his 
scholarship, and that of an ascetic in his forgiveness.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. Give up a member to save a family, a family to 
save a village, a village to save a country, and the country to save yourself.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. There is no poverty for the industrious. Sin does 
not attach itself to the person practicing japa (chanting of the holy names of 
the Lord). Those who are absorbed in maunam (silent contemplation of the Lord) 
have no quarrel with others. They are fearless who remain always alert.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. What is too heavy for the strong and what place is 
too distant for those who put forth effort? </span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. What country is foreign to a man of true learning? 
Who can be inimical to one who speaks pleasingly?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. As a whole forest becomes fragrant by the 
existence of a single tree with sweet-smelling blossoms in it, so a family 
becomes famous by the birth of a virtuous son.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. As a single withered tree, if set aflame, causes a 
whole forest to burn, so does a rascal son destroy a whole family.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. As night looks delightful when the moon shines, so 
is a family gladdened by even one learned and virtuous son.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. What is the use of having many sons if they cause 
grief and vexation? It is better to have only one son from whom the whole family 
can derive support and peacefulness.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. Fondle a son until he is five years of age, and 
use the stick for another ten years, but when he has attained his sixteenth year 
treat him as a friend.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. He who runs away from a fearful calamity, a 
foreign invasion, a terrible famine, and the companionship of wicked men is 
safe.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. He who has not acquired one of the following: 
religious merit (dharma), wealth (artha), satisfaction of desires (kama), or 
liberation (moksa) is repeatedly born to die</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth, comes of Her own 
accord where fools are not respected, grain is well stored up, and the husband 
and wife do not quarrel.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
