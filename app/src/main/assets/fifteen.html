<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 15</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. For one whose heart melts with compassion for all 
creatures; what is the necessity of knowledge, liberation, matted hair on the 
head, and smearing the body with ashes?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. There is no treasure on earth the gift of which 
will cancel the debt a disciple owes his guru for having taught him even a 
single letter (that leads to Krsna consciousness).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. There are two ways to get rid of thorns and wicked 
persons; using footwear in the first place and in the second shaming them so 
that they cannot raise their faces again thus keeping them at a distance.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. He who wears unclean garments, has dirty teeth, is 
a glutton, speaks unkindly and sleeps after sunrise -- although he may be the 
greatest personality -- will lose the favour of Lakshmi.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. He who loses his money is forsaken by his friends, 
his wife, his servants and his relations; yet when he regains his riches those 
who have forsaken him come back to him. Hence wealth is certainly the best of 
relations.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. Sinfully acquired wealth may remain for ten years; 
in the eleventh year it disappears with even the original stock.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. A bad action committed by a great man is not 
censured (as there is none that can reproach him), and a good action performed 
by a low-class man comes to be condemned (because none respects him). Just see: 
the drinking of nectar is excellent, but it became the cause of Rahu's demise; 
and the drinking of poison is harmful, but when Lord Shiva (who is exalted) 
drank it, it became an ornament to his neck (nila-kantha).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. A true meal is that which consists of the remnants 
left after a brahmana's meal. Love, which is shown to others, is true love, not 
that which is cherished for one's own self. To abstain from sin is true wisdom. 
That is an act of charity, which is performed without ostentation.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. For want of discernment the most precious jewels 
lie in the dust at the feet of men while bits of glass are worn on their heads. 
But we should not imagine that the gems have sunk in value, and the bits of 
glass have risen in importance. When a person of critical judgement shall 
appear, each will be given its right position.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. Sastric (scriptural) knowledge is unlimited, and 
the arts to be learned are many; the time we have is short, and our 
opportunities to learn are beset with obstacles. Therefore select for learning 
that which is most important, just as the swan drinks only the milk in water.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. He is a chandala who eats his dinner without 
entertaining the stranger who has come to his house quite accidentally, having 
travelled from a long distance and is wearied.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. One may know the four Vedas and the 
Dharma-sastras, yet if he has no realisation of his own spiritual self, he can 
be said to be like the ladle (spoon) which stirs all kinds of foods but knows 
not the taste of any.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. Those blessed souls are certainly elevated who, 
while crossing the ocean of life, take shelter of a genuine brahmana, who is 
likened unto a boat. They are unlike passengers aboard an ordinary ship that 
runs the risk of sinking.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. The moon, who is the abode of nectar and the 
presiding deity of all medicines, although immortal like amrta and resplendent 
in form, loses the brilliance of his rays when he repairs to the abode of the 
sun (day time). Therefore, will not an ordinary man be made to feel inferior by 
going to live at the house of another?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. This humble bee, which always resides among the 
soft petals of the lotus and drinks abundantly its sweet nectar, is now feasting 
on the flower of the ordinary kutaja. Being in a strange country where the 
lotuses do not exist, he is considering the pollen of the kutaja to be nice.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. (Lord Visnu asked His spouse Lakshmi why She did 
not care to live in the house of a brahmana.She replied:)" O Lord a rishi named 
Agastya drank up My father (the ocean) in anger; Brighu Muni kicked You; 
brahmanas pride themselves on their learning having sought the favour of My 
competitor Sarasvati; and lastly they pluck each day the lotus which is My 
abode, and therewith worship Lord Shiva. Therefore, O Lord, I fear to dwell with 
a brahmana".</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. There are many ways of binding by which one can be 
dominated and controlled in this world, but the bond of affection is the 
strongest. For example, take the case of the humble bee, which, although expert 
at piercing hardened wood, becomes caught in the embrace of its beloved flowers 
(as the petals close at dusk).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. Although sandalwood is cut, it does not forsake 
its natural quality of fragrance; so also the elephant does not give up 
sportiveness though he should grow old. The sugarcane does not cease to be sweet 
though squeezed in a mill; so the man of noble extraction does not lose his 
lofty qualities, no matter how pinched he is by poverty.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
