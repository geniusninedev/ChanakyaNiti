<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 16</strong></span><strong><br class="auto-style3" />
</strong><br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. The heart of a woman is not united; it is divided. 
While she is talking with one man, she looks lustfully at another and thinks 
fondly of a third in her heart.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. The fool (mudha) who fancies that a charming young 
lady loves him, becomes her slave and he dances like a shakuntal bird tied to a 
string.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. Who is there who, having become rich, has not 
become proud? What licentious man has put an end to his calamities? What man in 
this world has not been overcome by a woman? Who is always loved by the king? 
Who is there who has not been overcome by the ravages of time? What beggar has 
attained glory? Who has become happy by contracting the vices of the wicked?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. A man attains greatness by his merits, not simply 
by occupying an exalted seat. Can we call a crow an eagle (garuda) simply 
because he sits on the top of a tall building.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. The man who is praised by others as great is 
regarded as worthy though he may be really void of all merit. But the man who 
sings his own praises lowers himself in the estimation of others though he 
should be Indra (the possessor of all excellences).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. If good qualities should characterise a man of 
discrimination, the brilliance of his qualities will be recognised just as a 
gem, which is essentially bright, really shines when fixed in an ornament of 
gold.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Even one who by his qualities appears to be all 
knowing suffers without patronage; the gem, though precious, requires a gold 
setting.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. I do not deserve that wealth which is to be 
attained by enduring much suffering, or by transgressing the rules of virtue, or 
by flattering an enemy.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. Those who were not satiated with the enjoyment of 
wealth, food and women have all passed away; there are others now passing away 
who have likewise remained unsatiated; and in the future still others will pass 
away feeling themselves unsatiated.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. All charities and sacrifices (performed for 
fruitive gain) bring only temporary results.</span></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style1">11. I do not deserve that 
wealth which is to be attained by enduring much suffering, or by transgressing 
the rules of virtue, or by flattering an enemy.<br />
<br />
13. Those who were not satiated with the enjoyment of wealth, food and women 
have all passed away; there are others now passing away who have likewise 
remained unsatiated; and in the future still others will pass away feeling 
themselves unsatiated.<br />
<br />
14. All charities and sacrifices (performed for fruitive gain) bring only 
temporary results, but gifts made to deserving persons and protection offered to 
all creatures shall never perish<br />
<br />
15. A blade of grass is light, cotton is lighter, and the beggar is infinitely 
lighter still. Why then does not the wind carry him away? Because it fears that 
he may ask alms of him.<br />
<br />
16. It is better to die than to preserve this life by incurring disgrace. The 
loss of life causes but a moment's grief, but disgrace brings grief every day of 
one's life.<br />
<br />
17. All the creatures are pleased by loving words; and therefore we should 
address words that are pleasing to all, for there is no lack of sweet words.<br />
<br />
18. There are two nectarine fruits hanging from the tree of this world: one is 
the hearing of sweet words (such as Krsna-katha) and the other, the society of 
saintly men.<br />
<br />
19. The good habits of charity, learning and austerity practised during many 
past lives continue to be cultivated in this birth by virtue of the link (yoga) 
of this present life to the previous ones.<br />
<br />
20. One whose knowledge is confined to books and whose wealth is in the 
possession of others, can use neither his knowledge nor wealth when the need for 
them arises.</span></p>
