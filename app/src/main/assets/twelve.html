<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 12</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. He is a blessed grhasta (householder) in whose 
house there is a blissful atmosphere, whose sons are talented, whose wife speaks 
sweetly, whose wealth is enough to satisfy his desires, who finds pleasure in 
the company of his wife, whose servants are obedient, in whose house hospitality 
is shown, the auspicious Supreme Lord is worshiped daily, delicious food and 
drink is partaken, and who finds joy in the company of devotees.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. One who devotedly gives a little to a brahmana who 
is in distress is recompensed abundantly. Hence, O Prince, what is given to a 
good brahmana is got back not in an equal quantity, but in an infinitely higher 
degree.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. Those men who are happy in this world, who are 
generous towards their relatives, kind to strangers, indifferent to the wicked, 
loving to the good, shrewd in their dealings with the base, frank with the 
learned, courageous with enemies, humble with elders and stern with the wife.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. O jackal, leave aside the body of that man at once, 
whose hands have never given in charity, whose ears have not heard the voice of 
learning, whose eyes have not beheld a pure devotee of the Lord, whose feet have 
never traversed to holy places, whose belly is filled with things obtained by 
crooked practices, and whose head is held high in vanity. Do not eat it, O 
jackal, otherwise you will become polluted.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. "Shame upon those who have no devotion to the lotus 
feet of Sri Krsna, the son of mother Yasoda; who have no attachment for the 
descriptions of the glories of Srimati Radharani; whose ears are not eager to 
listen to the stories of the Lord's lila." Such is the exclamation of the 
mrdanga sound of dhik-tam dhik-tam dhigatam at kirtana.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. What fault of spring that the bamboo shoot has no 
leaves? What fault of the sun if the owl cannot see during the daytime? Is it 
the fault of the clouds if no raindrops fall into the mouth of the chatak bird? 
Who can erase what Lord Brahma has inscribed upon our foreheads at the time of 
birth?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. A wicked man may develop saintly qualities in the 
company of a devotee, but a devotee does not become impious in the company of a 
wicked person. The earth is scented by a flower that falls upon it, but the 
flower does not contact the odour of the earth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. One indeed becomes blessed by having darshan of a 
devotee; for the devotee has the ability to purify immediately, whereas the 
sacred tirtha gives purity only after prolonged contact.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. A stranger asked a brahmana, "Tell me, who is great 
in this city?" The brahmana replied, "The cluster of palmyra trees is great." 
Then the traveller asked, "Who is the most charitable person?" The brahmana 
answered, "The washer man who takes the clothes in the morning and gives them 
back in the evening is the most charitable." He then asked, "Who is the ablest 
man?" The brahmana answered, "Everyone is expert in robbing others of their 
wives and wealth." The man then asked the brahmana, "How do you manage to live 
in such a city?" The brahmana replied, "As a worm survives while even in a 
filthy place so do I survive here!"</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. The house in which the lotus feet of brahmanas are 
not washed, in which Vedic mantras are not loudly recited, and in which the holy 
rites of svaha (sacrificial offerings to the Supreme Lord) and swadha (offerings 
to the ancestors) are not performed, is like a crematorium.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. (It is said that a sadhu, when asked about his 
family, replied thusly): truth is my mother, and my father is spiritual 
knowledge; righteous conduct is my brother, and mercy is my friend, inner peace 
is my wife, and forgiveness is my son: these six are my kinsmen.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. Our bodies are perishable, wealth is not at all 
permanent and death is always nearby. Therefore we must immediately engage in 
acts of merit.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. Arjuna says to Krsna. "Brahmanas find joy in going 
to feasts, cows find joy in eating their tender grass, wives find joy in the 
company of their husbands, and know, O Krsna, that in the same way I rejoice in 
battle.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. He who regards another's wife as his mother, the 
wealth that does not belong to him as a lump of mud, and the pleasure and pain 
of all other living beings as his own -- truly sees things in the right 
perspective, and he is a true pandit.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. O Raghava, the Love of virtue, pleasing speech, 
and an ardent desire for performing acts of charity, guileless dealings with 
friends, humility in the guru's presence, deep tranquillity of mind, pure 
conduct, discernment of virtues, realised knowledge of the sastras, beauty of 
form and devotion to God are all found in you." (The great sage Vasistha Muni, 
the spiritual preceptor of the dynasty of the sun, said this to Lord Ramachandra 
at the time of His proposed coronation)</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. Kalpataru (the wish fulfilling tree) is but wood; 
the golden Mount Meru is motionless; the wish-fulfilling gem chintamani is just 
a stone; the sun is scorching; the moon is prone to wane; the boundless ocean is 
saline; the demigod of lust lost his body (due to Shiva's wrath); Bali Maharaja, 
the son of Diti, was born into a clan of demons; and Kamadhenu (the cow of 
heaven) is a mere beast. O Lord of the Raghu dynasty! I cannot compare you to 
any one of these (taking their merits into account).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. Realised learning (vidya) is our friend while 
travelling, the wife is a friend at home, medicine is the friend of a sick man, 
and meritorious deeds are the friends at death.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. Courtesy should be learned from princes, the art 
of conversation from pandits, lying should be learned from gamblers and 
deceitful ways should be learned from women.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. The unthinking spender, the homeless urchin, the 
quarrel monger, the man who neglects his wife and is heedless in his actions -- 
all these will soon come to ruination.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. The wise man should not be anxious about his food; 
he should be anxious to be engaged only in dharma (Krsna consciousness). The 
food of each man is created for him at his birth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. He who is not shy in the acquisition of wealth, 
grain and knowledge, and in taking his meals, will be happy</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">22. As centesimal droppings will fill a pot so also 
are knowledge, virtue and wealth gradually obtained.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">23. The man who remains a fool even in advanced age is 
really a fool, just as the Indra-Varuna fruit does not become sweet no matter 
how ripe it might become.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
