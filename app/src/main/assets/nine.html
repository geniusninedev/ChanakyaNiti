<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 9</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. My dear child, if you desire to be free from the 
cycle of birth and death, then abandon the objects of sense gratification as 
poison. Drink instead the nectar of forbearance, upright conduct, mercy, 
cleanliness and truth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. Those base men who speak of the secret faults of 
others destroy themselves like serpents that stray onto anthills.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. Perhaps nobody has advised Lord Brahma, the 
creator, to impart perfume to gold; fruit to the sugarcane; flowers to the 
sandalwood tree; wealth to the learned; and long life to the king</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. Nectar (amrita) is the best among medicines; eating 
good food is the best of all types of material happiness; the eye is the chief 
among all organs; and the head occupies the chief position among all parts of 
the body.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. No messenger can travel about in the sky and no 
tidings come from there. The voice of its inhabitants is never heard, nor can 
any contact be established with them. Therefore the brahmana who predicts the 
eclipse of the sun and moon, which occur in the sky, must be considered as a 
vidwan (man of great learning).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. The student, the servant, the traveller, the hungry 
person, the frightened man, the treasury guard, and the steward: these seven 
ought to be awakened if they fall asleep.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. The serpent, the king, the tiger, the stinging 
wasp, the small child, the dog owned by other people, and the fool: these seven 
ought not to be awakened from sleep.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. Of those who have studied the Vedas for material 
rewards, and those who accept foodstuffs offered by shudras, what potency have 
they? They are just like serpents without fangs.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. He who neither rouses fear by his anger, nor 
confers a favour when he is pleased can neither control nor protect. What can he 
do?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. The serpent may, without being poisonous, raise 
high its hood, but the show of terror is enough to frighten people -- whether he 
be venomous or not.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. Wise men spend their mornings in discussing 
gambling, the afternoon discussing the activities of women, and the night 
hearing about the activities of theft. (The first item above refers to the 
gambling of King Yudhisthira, the great devotee of Krsna. The second item refers 
to the glorious deeds of mother Sita, the consort of Lord Ramachandra. The third 
item hints at the adorable childhood pastimes of Sri Krsna who stole butter from 
the elderly cowherd ladies of Gokula. Hence Chanakya Quotes advises wise persons 
to spend the morning absorbed in Mahabharata, the afternoon studying Ramayana, 
and the evening devotedly hearing the Srimad-Bhagvatam.)</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. By preparing a garland for a Deity with one's own 
hand; by grinding sandal paste for the Lord with one's own hand; and by writing 
sacred texts with one's own hand -- one becomes blessed with opulence equal to 
that of Indra.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. Poverty is set off by fortitude; shabby garments 
by keeping them clean; bad food by warming it; and ugliness by good behavior.</span></p>
