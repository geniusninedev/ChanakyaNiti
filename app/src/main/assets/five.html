<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 5</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. Agni is the worship-able person for the twice born; 
the brahmana for the other castes; the husband for the wife; and the guest who 
comes for food at the midday meal for all.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. As gold is tested in four ways by rubbing, cutting, 
heating and beating -- so a man should be tested by these four things: his 
renunciation, his conduct, his qualities and his actions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. A thing may be dreaded as long as it has not 
overtaken you, but once it has come upon you, try to get rid of it without 
hesitation.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. Though persons be born from the same womb and under 
the same stars, they do not become alike in disposition as the thousand fruits 
of the badari tree.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. He whose hands are clean does not like to hold an 
office; he who desires nothing cares not for bodily decorations; he who is only 
partially educated cannot speak agreeably; and he who speaks out plainly cannot 
be a deceiver.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. The learned are envied by the foolish; rich men by 
the poor; chaste women by adulteresses; and beautiful ladies by ugly ones</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Indolent application ruins study; money is lost 
when entrusted to others; a farmer who sows his seed sparsely is ruined; and an 
army is lost for want of a commander.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. Learning is retained through putting into practice; 
family prestige is maintained through good behavior; a respectable person is 
recognized by his excellent qualities; and anger is seen in the eyes.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. Religion is preserved by wealth; knowledge by 
diligent practice; a king by conciliatory words; and a home by a dutiful 
housewife.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. Those who blaspheme Vedic wisdom, who ridicule the 
life style recommended in the satras, and who deride men of peaceful 
temperament, come to grief unnecessarily.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. Charity puts and end to poverty; righteous conduct 
to misery; discretion to ignorance; and scrutiny to fear.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. There is no disease (so destructive) as lust; no 
enemy like infatuation; no fire like wrath; and no happiness like spiritual 
knowledge.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. A man is born alone and dies alone; and he 
experiences the good and bad consequences of his karma alone; and he goes alone 
to hell or the Supreme abode.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. Heaven is but a straw to him who knows spiritual 
life (Krsna consciousness); so is life to a valiant man; a woman to him who has 
subdued his senses; and the universe to him who is without attachment for the 
world.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. Learning is a friend on the journey; a wife in the 
house; medicine in sickness; and religious merit is the only friend after death.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. Rain which falls upon the sea is useless; so is 
food for one who is satiated; in vain is a gift for one who is wealthy; and a 
burning lamp during the daytime is useless.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. There is no water like rainwater; no strength like 
one's own; no light like that of the eyes; and no wealth more dear than food 
grain.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. The poor wish for wealth; animals for the faculty 
of speech; men wish for heaven; and godly persons for liberation.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. The earth is supported by the power of truth; it 
is the power of truth that makes the sunshine and the winds blow; indeed all 
things rest upon truth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. The Goddess of wealth is unsteady (chanchala), and 
so is the life breath. The duration of life is uncertain, and the place of 
habitation is uncertain; but in all this inconsistent world religious merit 
alone is immovable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. Among men the barber is cunning; among birds the 
crow; among beasts the jackal; and among women, the malin (flower girl).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">22. These five are your fathers; he who gave you 
birth, girdled you with sacred thread, teaches you, provides you with food, and 
protects you from fearful situations.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">23. These five should be considered as mothers; the 
king's wife, the preceptor's wife, the friend's wife, your wife's mother, and 
your own mother</span>.</p>
