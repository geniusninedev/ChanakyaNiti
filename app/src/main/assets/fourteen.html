<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 14</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. Poverty, disease, sorrow, imprisonment and other 
evils are the fruits borne by the tree of one's own sins.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. Wealth, a friend, a wife, and a kingdom may be 
regained; but this body when lost may never be acquired again.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. The enemy can be overcome by the union of large 
numbers, just as grass through its collectiveness wards off erosion caused by 
heavy rainfall.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. Oil on water, a secret communicated to a base man, 
a gift given to a worthy receiver, and scriptural instruction given to an 
intelligent man spread out by virtue of their nature.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. If men should always retain the state of mind they 
experience when hearing religious instruction, when present at a crematorium 
ground, and when in sickness -- then who could not attain liberation.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. If a man should feel before, as he feels after, 
repentance -- then who would not attain perfection?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. We should not feel pride in our charity, austerity, 
valour, scriptural knowledge, modesty and morality for the world is full of the 
rarest gems.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. He who lives in our mind is near though he may 
actually be far away; but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really 
be nearby.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. We should always speak what would please the man of 
whom we expect a favour, like the hunter who sings sweetly when he desires to 
shoot a deer.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. It is ruinous to be familiar with the king, fire, 
the religious preceptor, and a woman. To be altogether indifferent to them is to 
be deprived of the opportunity to benefit ourselves, hence our association with 
them must be from a safe distance.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. We should always deal cautiously with fire, water, 
women, foolish people, serpents, and members of a royal family; for they may, 
when the occasion presents itself, at once bring about our death.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. He should be considered to be living who is 
virtuous and pious, but the life of a man who is destitute of religion and 
virtues is void of any blessing.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. If you wish to gain control of the world by the 
performance of a single deed, then keep the following fifteen, which are prone 
to wander here and there, from getting the upper hand of you: the five sense 
objects (objects of sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch); the five sense 
organs (ears, eyes, nose, tongue and skin) and organs of activity (hands, legs, 
mouth, genitals and anus).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. He is a pandit (man of knowledge) who speaks what 
is suitable to the occasion, who renders loving service according to his 
ability, and who knows the limits of his anger. </span>
<br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15 One single object (a woman) appears in three 
different ways: to the man who practices austerity it appears as a corpse, to 
the sensual it appears as a woman, and to the dogs as a lump of flesh.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. A wise man should not divulge the formula of a 
medicine which he has well prepared; an act of charity which he has performed; 
domestic conflicts; private affairs with his wife; poorly prepared food he may 
have been offered; or slang he may have heard. </span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. The cuckoos remain silent for a long time (for 
several seasons) until they are able to sing sweetly (in the Spring) so as to 
give joy to all.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. We should secure and keep the following: the 
blessings of meritorious deeds, wealth, grain, the words of the spiritual 
master, and rare medicines. Otherwise life becomes impossible.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. Eschew wicked company and associate with saintly 
persons. Acquire virtue day and night, and always meditate on that which is 
eternal forgetting that which is temporary.</span></p>
