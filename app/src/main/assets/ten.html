<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 10</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. One destitute of wealth is not destitute, he is 
indeed rich (if he is learned); but the man devoid of learning is destitute in 
every way.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. We should carefully scrutinise that place upon 
which we step (having it ascertained to be free from filth and living creatures 
like insects, etc.); we should drink water, which has been filtered (through a 
clean cloth); we should speak only those words, which have the sanction of the 
satras; and do that act which we have carefully considered.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. He who desires sense gratification must give up all 
thoughts of acquiring knowledge; and he who seeks knowledge must not hope for 
sense gratification. How can he who seeks sense gratification acquire knowledge, 
and he who possesses knowledge enjoy mundane sense pleasure?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. What is it that escapes the observation of poets? 
What is that act women are incapable of doing? What will drunken people not 
prate? What will not a crow eat?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. Fate makes a beggar a king and a king a beggar. He 
makes a rich man poor and a poor man rich</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. The beggar is a miser's enemy; the wise counsellor 
is the fool's enemy; her husband is an adulterous wife's enemy; and the moon is 
the enemy of the thief.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Those who are destitute of learning, penance, 
knowledge, good disposition, virtue and benevolence are brutes wandering the 
earth in the form of men. They are burdensome to the earth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. Those that are empty-minded cannot be benefited by 
instruction. Bamboo does not acquire the quality of sandalwood by being 
associated with the Malaya Mountain.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. What good can the scriptures do to a man who has no 
sense of his own? Of what use is as mirror to a blind man?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. Nothing can reform a bad man, just as the 
posteriors cannot become a superior part of the body though washed one hundred 
times.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. By offending a kinsman, life is lost; by offending 
others, wealth is lost; by offending the king, everything is lost; and by 
offending a brahmana (Brahmin) one's whole family is ruined.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. It is better to live under a tree in a jungle 
inhabited by tigers and elephants, to maintain oneself in such a place with ripe 
fruits and spring water, to lie down on grass and to wear the ragged barks of 
trees than to live amongst one's relations when reduced to poverty.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. The brahmana (Brahmin) is like a tree; his prayers 
are the roots, his chanting of the Vedas are the branches, and his religious 
acts are the leaves. Consequently effort should be made to preserve his roots 
for if the roots are destroyed there can be no branches or leaves.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. My mother is Kamala devi (Lakshmi), my father is 
Lord Janardana (Vishnu), my kinsmen are the Vishnu-bhaktas (Vaisnavas) and, my 
homeland is all the three worlds.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. (Through the night) a great many kinds of birds 
perch on a tree but in the morning they fly in all the ten directions. Why 
should we lament for that? (Similarly, we should not grieve when we must 
inevitably part company from our dear ones)</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. He who possesses intelligence is strong; how can 
the man that is unintelligent be powerful? The elephant of the forest having 
lost his senses by intoxication was tricked into a lake by a small rabbit. (This 
verse refers to a famous story from the niti-sastra called pancatantra compiled 
by the pandit Vishnusharma 2500 years ago).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. Why should I be concerned for my maintenance while 
absorbed in praising the glories of Lord Vishwambhara (Vishnu), the supporter of 
all? Without the grace of Lord Hari, how could milk flow from a mother's breast 
for a child's nourishment? Repeatedly thinking only in this way, O Lord of the 
Yadus, O husband of Lakshmi, all my time is spent in serving Your lotus feet.</span></p>
