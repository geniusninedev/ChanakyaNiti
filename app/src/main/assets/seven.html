<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 7</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. A wise man should not reveal his loss of wealth, 
the vexation of his mind, the misconduct of his own wife, base words spoken by 
others, and disgrace that has befallen him.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. He who gives up shyness in monetary dealings, in 
acquiring knowledge, in eating and in business, becomes happy.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. The happiness and peace attained by those satisfied 
by the nectar of spiritual tranquillity is not attained by greedy persons 
restlessly moving here and there.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. One should feel satisfied with the following three 
things; his own wife, food given by Providence and wealth acquired by honest 
effort; but one should never feel satisfied with the following three; study, 
chanting the holy names of the Lord (japa) and charity.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. Do not pass between two brahmanas, between a 
brahmana and his sacrificial fire, between a wife and her husband, a master and 
his servant, and a plough and an ox.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. Do not let your foot touch fire, the spiritual 
master or a brahmana; it must never touch a cow, a virgin, an old person or a 
child.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Keep one thousand cubits away from an elephant, a 
hundred from a horse, ten from a horned beast, but keep away from the wicked by 
leaving the country.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. An elephant is controlled by a goad (ankusha), a 
horse by a slap of the hand, a horned animal with the show of a stick, and a 
rascal with a sword.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. Brahmanas find satisfaction in a good meal, 
peacocks in the peal of thunder, a sadhu in seeing the prosperity of others, and 
the wicked in the misery of others.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. Conciliate a strong man by submission, a wicked 
man by opposition, and the one whose power is equal to yours by politeness or 
force.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. The power of a king lies in his mighty arms; that 
of a brahmana in his spiritual knowledge; and that of a woman in her beauty 
youth and sweet words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. Do not be very upright in your dealings for you 
would see by going to the forest that straight trees are cut down while crooked 
ones are left standing.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. Swans live wherever there is water, and leave the 
place where water dries up; let not a man act so -- and comes and goes as he 
pleases.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. Accumulated wealth is saved by spending just as 
incoming fresh water is saved by letting out stagnant water.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. He who has wealth has friends and relations; he 
alone survives and is respected as a man.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. The following four characteristics of the denizens 
of heaven may be seen in the residents of this earth planet; charity, sweet 
words, worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and satisfying the needs 
of brahmanas.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. The following qualities of the denizens of hell 
may characterize men on earth; extreme wrath, harsh speech, enmity with one's 
relations, the company with the base, and service to men of low extraction.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. By going to the den of a lion pearls from the head 
of an elephant may be obtained; but by visiting the hole of a jackal nothing but 
the tail of a calf or a bit of the hide of an ass may be found.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. The life of an uneducated man is as useless as the 
tail of a dog, which neither covers its rear end, nor protects it from the bites 
of insects.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. Purity of speech, of the mind, of the senses, and 
a compassionate heart are needed by one who desires to rise to the divine 
platform.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. As you seek fragrance in a flower, oil in the 
sesamum seed, fire in wood, ghee (butter) in milk, and jaggery (guda) in 
sugarcane; so seek the spirit that is in the body by means of discrimination.</span></p>
