<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 8</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. Low class men desire wealth; middle class men both 
wealth and respect; but the noble, honour only; hence honour is the noble man's 
true wealth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. The lamp eats up the darkness and therefore it 
produces blackened lamp; in the same way according to the nature of our diet 
(sattva, rajas, or tamas) we produce offspring in similar quality.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. O wise man! Give your wealth only to the worthy and 
never to others. The water of the sea received by the clouds is always sweet. 
The rainwater enlivens all living beings of the earth both movable (insects, 
animals, humans, etc.) and immovable (plants, trees, etc.), and then returns to 
the ocean where its value is multiplied a million fold.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. The wise who discern the essence of things have 
declared that the yavana (meat eater) is equal in baseness to a thousand 
candalas (the lowest class), and hence a yavana is the basest of men; indeed 
there is no one more base.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. After having rubbed oil on the body, after 
encountering the smoke from a funeral pyre, after sexual intercourse, and after 
being shaved, one remains a chandala until he bathes.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. Water is the medicine for indigestion; it is 
invigorating when the food that is eaten is well digested; it is like nectar 
when drunk in the middle of a dinner; and it is like poison when taken at the 
end of a meal.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Knowledge is lost without putting it into practice; 
a man is lost due to ignorance; an army is lost without a commander; and a woman 
is lost without a husband.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. A man who encounters the following three is 
unfortunate; the death of his wife in his old age, the entrusting of money into 
the hands of relatives, and depending upon others for food.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. Chanting of the Vedas without making ritualistic 
sacrifices to the Supreme Lord through the medium of Agni, and sacrifices not 
followed by bountiful gifts are futile. Perfection can be achieved only through 
devotion (to the Supreme Lord) for devotion is the basis of all success.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. There is no austerity equal to a balanced mind, 
and there is no happiness equal to contentment; there is no disease like 
covetousness, and no virtue like mercy.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. Anger is a personification of Yama (the demigod of 
death); thirst is like the hellish river Vaitarani; knowledge is like a 
kamadhenu (the cow of plenty); and contentment is like Nandanavana (the garden 
of Indra).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. Moral excellence is an ornament for personal 
beauty; righteous conduct, for high birth; success for learning; and proper 
spending for wealth.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. Beauty is spoiled by an immoral nature; noble 
birth by bad conduct; learning, without being perfected; and wealth by not being 
properly utilised.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. Water seeping into the earth is pure; and a 
devoted wife is pure; the king who is the benefactor of his people is pure; and 
pure is the brahmana who is contented.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. Discontented brahmanas, contented kings, shy 
prostitutes, and immodest housewives are ruined.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. Of what avail is a high birth if a person is 
destitute of scholarship? A man who is of low extraction is honoured even by the 
demigods if he is learned.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. A learned man is honoured by the people. A learned 
man commands respect everywhere for his learning. Indeed, learning is honoured 
everywhere.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. Those who are endowed with beauty and youth and 
who are born of noble families are worthless if they have no learning. They are 
just like the kimshuka blossoms ( flowers of the palasa tree) which, though 
beautiful, have no fragrance.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. The earth is encumbered with the weight of the 
flesh-eaters, wine-bibblers, dolts (dull and stupid) and blockheads, who are 
beasts in the form of men.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. There is no enemy like a yajna (sacrifice) which 
consumes the kingdom when not attended by feeding on a large scale; consumes the 
priest when the chanting is not done properly; and consumes the yajaman (the 
responsible person) when the gifts are not made.</span></p>
