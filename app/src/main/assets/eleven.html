<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 11</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. Generosity, pleasing address, courage and propriety 
of conduct are not acquired, but are inbred qualities.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. He who forsakes his own community and joins another 
perishes as the king who embraces an unrighteous path.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. The elephant has a huge body but is controlled by 
the ankusha (goad): yet, is the goad as large as the elephant? A lighted candle 
banishes darkness: is the candle as vast as the darkness. A mountain is broken 
even by a thunderbolt: is the thunderbolt therefore as big as the mountain? No, 
he whose power prevails is really mighty; what is there in bulk?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. He who is engrossed in family life will never 
acquire knowledge; there can be no mercy in the eater of flesh; the greedy man 
will not be truthful; and purity will not be found in a woman or a hunter.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. The wicked man will not attain sanctity even if he 
is instructed in different ways, and the Nim tree will not become sweet even if 
it is sprinkled from the top to the roots with milk and ghee.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Mental dirt cannot be washed away even by 
one-hundred baths in the sacred waters, just as a wine pot cannot be purified 
even by evaporating all the wine by fire.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. It is not strange if a man reviles a thing of which 
he has no knowledge, just as a wild hunter's wife throws away the pearl that is 
found in the head of an elephant, and picks up a gunj (a type of seed which poor 
tribals wear as ornaments).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. He who for one year eats his meals silently 
(inwardly meditating upon the Lord's prasadam); attains to the heavenly planets 
for a thousand crore of years. ( Note: one crore equals ten million)</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. The student (brahmacari) should completely 
renounce the following eight things -- his lust, anger, greed, desire for 
sweets, sense of decorating the body, excessive curiosity, excessive sleep, and 
excessive endeavour for bodily maintenance.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. He alone is a true brahmana (dvija or 
"twice-born") who is satisfied with one meal a day, who has the six samskaras 
(or acts of purification such as garbhadhana, etc.) performed for him, and who 
cohabits with his wife only once in a month on an auspicious day after her 
menses.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. The brahmana who is engrossed in worldly affairs, 
brings up cows and is engaged in trade is really called a vaishya.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. The brahmana who deals in lac-die, articles, oil, 
indigo, silken cloth, honey, clarified butter, liquor, and flesh is called a 
shudra.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. The brahmana who thwarts the doings of others, who 
is hypocritical, selfish, and a deceitful hater, and while speaking mildly 
cherishes cruelty in his heart, is called a cat.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. The brahmana who destroys a pond, a well, a tank, 
a garden and a temple is called a mleccha.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. The brahmana who steals the property of the 
Deities and the spiritual preceptor, who cohabits with another's wife, and who 
maintains himself by eating anything and everything s called a chandala.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. The meritorious should give away in charity all 
that they have in excess of their needs. By charity only Karna, Bali and King 
Vikramaditya survive even today. Just see the plight of the honeybees beating 
their legs in despair upon the earth. They are saying to themselves, "Alas! We 
neither enjoyed our stored-up honey nor gave it in charity, and now someone has 
taken it from us in an instant."</span></p>
