<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 13</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. A man may live but for a moment, but that moment 
should be spent in doing auspicious deeds. It is useless living even for a kalpa 
(4,320,000 *1000 years) and bringing only distress upon the two worlds (this 
world and the next).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. We should not fret for what is past, nor should we 
be anxious about the future; men of discernment deal only with the present 
moment.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. It certainly is nature of the demigods, men of good 
character, and parents to be easily pleased. Near and distant relatives are 
pleased when they are hospitably received with bathing, food, and drink; and 
pandits are pleased with an opportunity for giving spiritual discourse.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4 Even as the unborn babe is in the womb of his 
mother, these five are fixed as his life destiny: his life span, his activities, 
his acquisition of wealth and knowledge, and his time of death.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. Oh, see what a wonder it is! The doings of the 
great are strange: they treat wealth as light as a straw, yet, when they obtain 
it, they bend under its weight</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. He who is overly attached to his family members 
experiences fear and sorrow, for the root of all grief is attachment. Thus one 
should discard attachment to be happy.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. He who is prepared for the future and he who deals 
cleverly with any situation that may arise are both happy; but the fatalistic 
man who wholly depends on luck is ruined.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. If the king is virtuous, then the subjects are also 
virtuous. If the king is sinful, then the subjects also become sinful. If he is 
mediocre, then the subjects are mediocre. The subjects follow the example of the 
king. In short, as is the king so are the subjects.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. I consider him who does not act religiously as dead 
though living, but he who dies acting religiously unquestionably lives long 
though he is dead.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. He who has acquired neither virtue, wealth, 
satisfaction of desires nor salvation (dharma, artha, kama, moksa), lives an 
utterly useless life, like the "nipples" hanging from the neck of a goat.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. The hearts of base men burn before the fire of 
other's fame, and they slander them being themselves unable to rise to such a 
high position.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. Excessive attachment to sense pleasures leads to 
bondage, and detachment from sense pleasures leads to liberation; therefore it 
is the mind alone that is responsible for bondage or liberation</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. He who sheds bodily identification by means of 
knowledge of the indwelling Supreme Self (Paramatma), will always be absorbed in 
meditative trance (samadhi) wherever his mind leads him.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. Who realises all the happiness he desires? 
Everything is in the hands of God. Therefore one should learn contentment.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. As a calf follows its mother among a thousand 
cows, so the (good or bad) deeds of a man follow him.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. He whose actions are disorganised has no happiness 
either in the midst of men or in a jungle -- in the midst of men his heart burns 
by social contacts, and his helplessness burns him in the forest.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. As the man who digs obtains underground water by 
use of a shovel, so the student attains the knowledge possessed by his preceptor 
through his service</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. Men reap the fruits of their deeds, and intellects 
bear the mark of deeds performed in previous lives; even so the wise act after 
due circumspection.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. Even the man who has taught the spiritual 
significance of just one letter ought to be worshiped. He who does not give 
reverence to such a guru is born as a dog a hundred times, and at last takes 
birth as a chandala (dog-eater).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. At the end of the yuga, Mount Meru may be shaken; 
at the end of the kalpa, the waters of the seven oceans may be disturbed; but a 
sadhu will never swerve from the spiritual path.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. There are three gems upon this earth; food, water, 
and pleasing words -- fools (mudhas) consider pieces of rocks as gems.</span></p>
