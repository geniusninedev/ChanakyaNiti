<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style1"><strong>&nbsp;Chapter - 1</strong></span><br />
<br />
<span class="auto-style2">1. Humbly bowing down before the almighty Lord Sri 
Vishnu, the Lord of the three worlds, I recite maxims of the science of politics 
&amp; Political ethics ( Niti ) selected from the various shastra.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">2. That man who by the study of these maxims from the 
satras acquires a knowledge of the most celebrated principles of duty, and 
understands what ought and what ought not to be followed, and what is good and 
what is bad, is most excellent.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">3. Therefore with an eye to the public good, I shall 
speak that which, when understood, will lead to an understanding of things in 
their proper perspective.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">4. Even a pandit comes to grief by giving instruction 
to a foolish disciple, by maintaining a wicked wife, and by excessive 
familiarity with the miserable.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">5. A wicked wife, a false friend, a saucy servant and 
living in a house with a serpent in it are nothing but death.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">6. One should save his money against hard times, save 
his wife at the sacrifice of his riches, but invariably one should save his soul 
even at the sacrifice of his wife and riches.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">7. Save your wealth against future calamity. Do not 
say, "What fear has a rich man, of calamity?" When riches begin to forsake one 
even the accumulated stock dwindles away.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">8. Do not inhabit a country where you are not 
respected, cannot earn your livelihood, have no friends, or cannot acquire 
knowledge.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">9. Do not stay for a single day where there are not 
these five persons: a wealthy man, a brahmin well versed in Vedic lore, a king, 
a river and a physician</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">10. Wise men should never go into a country where 
there are no means of earning one's livelihood, where the people have no dread 
of anybody, have no sense of shame, no intelligence, or a charitable 
disposition.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">11. Test a servant while in the discharge of his duty, 
a relative in difficulty, a friend in adversity, and a wife in misfortune.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">12. He is a true friend who does not forsake us in 
time of need, misfortune, famine, or war, in a king's court, or at the 
crematorium (smasana).</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">13. He who gives up what is imperishable for that 
which is perishable, loses that which is imperishable; and doubtlessly loses 
that which is perishable also.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">14. A wise man should marry a virgin of a respectable 
family even if she is deformed. He should not marry one of a low-class family, 
through beauty. Marriage in a family of equal status is preferable.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">15. Do not put your trust in rivers, men who carry 
weapons, beasts with claws or horns, women, and members of a royal family</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">16. Even from poison extract nectar, wash and take 
back gold if it has fallen in filth, receive the highest knowledge (Krsna 
consciousness) from a low born person; so also a girl possessing virtuous 
qualities (stri-ratna) even if she were born in a disreputable family.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">17. Women have hunger two-fold, shyness four-fold, 
daring six-fold, and lust eight-fold as compared to men</span></p>
