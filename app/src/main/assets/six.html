<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style2"><strong>Chapter - 6</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. By means of hearing one understands dharma, 
malignity vanishes, knowledge is acquired, and liberation from material bondage 
is gained.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. Among birds the crow is vile; among beasts the dog; 
the ascetic whose sins is abominable, but he who blasphemes others is the worst 
chandala.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. Brass is polished by ashes; copper is cleaned by 
tamarind; a woman, by her menses; and a river by its flow.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. The king, the brahmana, and the ascetic yogi who go 
abroad are respected; but the woman who wanders is utterly ruined.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. He who has wealth has friends. He who is wealthy 
has relatives. The rich one alone is called a man, and the affluent alone are 
respected as pandits</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. As is the desire of Providence, so functions one's 
intellect; one's activities are also controlled by Providence; and by the will 
of Providence one is surrounded by helpers.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">7. Time perfects all living beings as well as kills 
them; it alone is awake when all others are asleep. Time is insurmountable.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. Those born blind cannot see; similarly blind are 
those in the grip of lust. Proud men have no perception of evil; and those bent 
on acquiring riches see no sin in their actions.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. The spirit soul goes through his own course of 
karma and he himself suffers the good and bad results thereby accrued. By his 
own actions he entangles himself in samsara, and by his own efforts he 
extricates himself.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. The king is obliged to accept the sins of his 
subjects; the purohit (priest) suffers for those of the king; a husband suffers 
for those of his wife; and the guru suffers for those of his pupils.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">11. A father who is a chronic debtor, an adulterous 
mother, a beautiful wife, and an unlearned son are enemies ( in one's own home).</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. Conciliate a covetous man by means of a gift, an 
obstinate man with folded hands in salutation, a fool by humoring him, and a 
learned man by truthful words.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">13. It is better to be without a kingdom than to rule 
over a petty one; better to be without a friend than to befriend a rascal; 
better to be without a disciple than to have a stupid one; and better to be 
without a wife than to have a bad one.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. How can people be made happy in a petty kingdom? 
What peace can we expect from a rascal friend? What happiness can we have at 
home in the company of a bad wife? How can renown be gained by instructing an 
unworthy disciple?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. Learn one thing from a lion; one from a crane; 
four a cock; five from a crow; six from a dog; and three from an ass.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. The one excellent thing that can be learned from a 
lion is that whatever a man intends doing should be done by him with a 
whole-hearted and strenuous effort.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. The wise man should restrain his senses like the 
crane and accomplish his purpose with due knowledge of his place, time and 
ability.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. To wake at the proper time; to take a bold stand 
and fight; to make a fair division (of property) among relations; and to earn 
one's own bread by personal exertion are the four excellent things to be learned 
from a cock.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. Union in privacy (with one's wife); boldness; 
storing away useful items; watchfulness; and not easily trusting others; these 
five things are to be learned from a crow.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. Contentment with little or nothing to eat although 
one may have a great appetite; to awaken instantly although one may be in a deep 
slumber; unflinching devotion to the master; and bravery; these six qualities 
should be learned from the dog.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. Although an ass is tired, he continues to carry 
his burden; he is unmindful of cold and heat; and he is always contented; these 
three things should be learned from the ass.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">22. He who shall practice these twenty virtues shall 
become invincible in all his undertakings.</span></p>
