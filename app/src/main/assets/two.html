<p class="auto-style3"><span class="auto-style4"><strong>Chapter - 2</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">1. Untruthfulness, rashness, guile, stupidity, 
avarice, uncleanliness and cruelty are a woman's seven natural flaws</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">2. To have ability for eating when dishes are ready at 
hand, to be robust and virile in the company of one's religiously wedded wife, 
and to have a mind for making charity when one is prosperous are the fruits of 
no ordinary austerities.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">3. He whose son is obedient to him, whose wife's 
conduct is in accordance with his wishes, and who is content with his riches, 
has his heaven here on earth.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">4. They alone are sons who are devoted to their 
father. He is a father who supports his sons. He is a friend in whom we can 
confide, and she only is a wife in whose company the husband feels contented and 
peaceful.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">5. Avoid him who talks sweetly before you but tries to 
ruin you behind your back, for he is like a pitcher of poison with milk on top.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">6. Do not put your trust in a bad companion nor even 
trust an ordinary friend, for if he should get angry with you, he may bring all 
your secrets to light.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">7. Do not reveal what you have thought upon doing, but 
by wise counsel keep it secret, being determined to carry it into execution.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">8. Foolishness is indeed painful, and verily so is 
youth, but more painful by far than either is being obliged in another person's 
house.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">9. There does not exist a pearl in every mountain, nor 
a pearl in the head of every elephant; neither are the sadhus to be found 
everywhere, nor sandal trees in every forest.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">[Note: Only elephants in royal palaces are seen 
decorated with pearls (precious stones) on their heads].</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">10. Wise men should always bring up their sons in 
various moral ways, for children who have knowledge of niti-sastra and are well 
behaved become a glory to their family.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">11. Those parents who do not educate their sons are 
their enemies; for as is a crane among swans, so are ignorant sons in a public 
assembly&gt;</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">12. Many a bad habit is developed through over 
indulgence, and many a good one by chastisement, therefore beat your son as well 
as your pupil; never indulge them. ("Spare the rod and spoil the child."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">13. Let not a single day pass without your learning a 
verse, half a verse, or a fourth of it, or even one letter of it; nor without 
attending to charity, study and other pious activity.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">14. Separation from the wife, disgrace from one's own 
people, an enemy saved in battle, service to a wicked king, poverty, and a 
mismanaged assembly: these six kinds of evils, if afflicting a person, burn him 
even without fire</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">15. Trees on a riverbank, a woman in another man's 
house, and kings without counselors go without doubt to swift destruction.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">16. A brahmin's strength is in his learning, a king's 
strength is in his army, a vaishya's strength is in his wealth and a shudra's 
strength is in his attitude of service</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">17. The prostitute has to forsake a man who has no 
money, the subject a king that cannot defend him, the birds a tree that bears no 
fruit, and the guests a house after they have finished their meals.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">18. Brahmins quit their patrons after receiving alms 
from them, scholars leave their teachers after receiving education from them, 
and animals desert a forest that has been burnt down.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">19. He who befriends a man whose conduct is vicious, 
whose vision impure, and who is notoriously crooked, is rapidly ruined.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">20. Friendship between equals flourishes, service 
under a king is respectable, it is good to be business-minded in public 
dealings, and a handsome lady is safe in her own home.</span></p>
