<p class="auto-style2"><span class="auto-style3"><strong>Chapter - 17</strong></span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">1. The scholar who has acquired knowledge by studying 
innumerable books without the blessings of a bonafide spiritual master does not 
shine in an assembly of truly learned men just as an illegitimate child is not 
honoured in society.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">2. We should repay the favours of others by acts of 
kindness; so also should we return evil for evil in which there is no sin, for 
it is necessary to pay a wicked man in his own coin.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">3. That thing which is distant, that thing which 
appears impossible, and that which is far beyond our reach, can be easily 
attained through tapasya (religious austerity), for nothing can surpass 
austerity.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">4. What vice could be worse than covetousness? What is 
more sinful than slander? For one who is truthful, what need is there for 
austerity? For one who has a clean heart, what is the need for pilgrimage? If 
one has a good disposition, what other virtue is needed? If a man has fame, what 
is the value of other ornamentation? What need is there for wealth for the man 
of practical knowledge? And if a man is dishonoured, what could there be worse 
than death?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">5. Though the sea, which is the reservoir of all 
jewels, is the father of the conch shell, and the Goddess of fortune Lakshmi is 
conch's sister, still the conch must go from door to door for alms (in the hands 
of a beggar). It is true, therefore, that one gains nothing without having given 
in the past.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">6. When a man has no strength left in him he becomes a 
sadhu, one without wealth acts like a brahmacari, a sick man behaves like a 
devotee of the Lord, and when a woman grows old she becomes devoted to her 
husband.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">8. There is poison in the fang of the serpent, in the 
mouth of the fly and in the sting of a scorpion; but the wicked man is saturated 
with it.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">9. The woman who fasts and observes religious vows 
without the permission of her husband shortens his life, and goes to hell.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">10. A woman does not become holy by offering charity, 
by observing hundreds of fasts, or by sipping sacred water, as by sipping the 
water used to wash her husbands feet.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">12. The hand is not so well adorned by ornaments as by 
charitable offerings; one does not become clean by smearing sandalwood paste 
upon the body as by taking a bath; one does not become so much satisfied by 
dinner as by having respect shown to him; and salvation is not attained by 
self-adornment as by cultivation of spiritual knowledge.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">14. The eating of tundi fruit deprives a man of his 
sense, while the vacha root administered revives his reasoning immediately. A 
woman at once robs a man of his vigour while milk at once restores it.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">15. He who nurtures benevolence for all creatures 
within his heart overcomes all difficulties and will be the recipient of all 
types of riches at every step.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">16. What is there to be enjoyed in the world of Lord 
Indra for one whose wife is loving and virtuous, who possesses wealth, who has a 
well-behaved son endowed with good qualities, and who has grandchildren born of 
his children?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">17. Men have eating, sleeping, fearing and mating in 
common with the lower animals. That in which men excel the beasts is 
discretionary knowledge; hence, indiscreet men who are without knowledge should 
be regarded as beasts.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">18. If the bees that seek the liquid oozing from the 
head of a lust-intoxicated elephant are driven away by the flapping of his ears, 
then the elephant has lost only the ornament of his head. The bees are quite 
happy in the lotus filled lake.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">19. A king, a prostitute, Lord Yamaraja, fire, a 
thief, a young boy, and a beggar cannot understand the suffering of others. The 
eighth of this category is the tax collector.</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">20. O lady, why are you gazing downward? Has something 
of yours fallen on the ground? (She replies) O fool, can you not understand the 
pearl of my youth has slipped away?</span><br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<br class="auto-style1" />
<span class="auto-style1">21. O ketki flower! Serpents live in your midst, you 
bear no edible fruits, your leaves are covered with thorns, you are crooked in 
growth, you thrive in mud, and you are not easily accessible. Still for your 
exceptional fragrance you are as dear as kinsmen to others. Hence, a single 
excellence overcomes a multitude of blemishes.</span></p>
