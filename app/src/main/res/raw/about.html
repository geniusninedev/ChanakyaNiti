<p class="auto-style3">&nbsp;<strong>About Chanakya's</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><strong>Life story</strong></p>
<p class="auto-style4"><br class="auto-style2" />
<img class="auto-style2" src="chankya.jpg"width="300"height="300" /><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Acharya Chanakya (350-275 BCE) , he traditionally 
identified as Kautilya or Vishnu Gupta </span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Birth</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Chanakya's birthplace is unknown , possibly Acharya 
Chanakya born in Kusumpur near Pataliputra (modern day Patna) city in ancient 
India . According to the Buddhist text Mahavamsa Tika, his birthplace was 
Taxila. According to some other Jain accounts, he was a native of South India. 
His father name was "Chanak"</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">When Chanakya was born he had a full set of teeth, 
which is a sign that he would become a king or an emperor. But since he was born 
in a Brahmin family, it was considered inappropriate. Thus, his teeth were 
broken and it was predicted that he would make another person a king and rule 
through him</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Even as a child, Chanakya had the qualities of a born 
leader. His level of knowledge was beyond children of his age.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Chanakya's Education</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Rishi Canak named his son as "Chanakya". Being a 
teacher himself, he knew the importance of education. Taxila was one of the 
world centres for education. At a very early age little Chanakya started 
studying Vedas. The Vedas; considered to be the toughest scriptures to study 
were completely studied and memorized by Chanakya in his infancy. He was 
attracted to studies in politics. In politics Chanakya’s acumen and shrewdness 
was visible right from childhood. He was a student of politics right from child 
hood. Known as a masterful political strategist, He knew how to put his own 
people in the opposite camp and spy the enemy without his knowledge before 
destroying him forever. Chanakya was an ace in turning tables in his favour 
irrespective of the circumstances. He never budged to pressure tactics by the 
ruthless politicians. In this way after studying religion and politics, he 
turned his attention to economics, which remained his lifelong friend. 
"Nitishastra", a treatise on the ideal way of life shows his in depth study of 
the Indian way of life</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Life as a student</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Takshashila, (later corrupted as Taxila),one of the 
topmost centers of education at that time in India became Chanakya’s breeding 
ground of acquiring knowledge in the practical and theoretical aspect. The 
teachers were highly knowledgeable who used to teach sons of kings. It is said 
that a certain teacher had 101 students and all of them were princes! The 
university at Taxila was well versed in teaching the subjects using the best of 
practical knowledge acquired by the teachers. The age of entering the university 
was sixteen. The branches of studies most sought after in around India ranged 
from law, medicine, warfare and other indigenous forms of learning. The four 
Vedas, archery, hunting, elephant-lore and 18 arts were taught at the university 
of Taxila. So prominent was the place where Chanakya received his education that 
it goes to show the making of the genius. The very requirements of admission 
filtered out the outlawed and people with lesser credentials.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">After acquiring vast knowledge in various branches of 
study he wanted everybody to get benefited. He believed in the broadcasting of 
knowledge and not in the storage of it. So famous was Chanakya in the vicinity 
of the university that he had many nicknames. He was called variously by 
different people, namely – Vishnugupta, Kautilya and Chanakya. The whole nation 
was bewildered by the cleverness and wit of this seemingly small boy who went on 
to single handedly unify the country with the sheer power of his character. He 
lived his life working to his capacity in pursuit of his vision of a happy 
strong and prosperous India.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Taxila University</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">At a time when the Dark Ages were looming large, the 
existence of a university of Taxila’s grandeur really makes India stand apart 
way ahead of the European countries who struggled with ignorance and total 
information blackout. For the Indian subcontinent Taxila stood as a light house 
of higher knowledge and pride of India. In the present day world, Taxila is 
situated in Pakistan at a place called Rawalpindi. The university accommodated 
more than 10,000 students at a time. The university offered courses spanning a 
period of more than eight years. The students were admitted after graduating 
from their own countries. Aspiring students opted for elective subjects going 
for in depth studies in specialized branches of learning. After graduating from 
the university, the students are recognized as the best scholars in the 
subcontinent. It became a cultural heritage as time passed. Taxila was the 
junction where people of different origins mingled with each other and exchanged 
knowledge of their countries. The university was famous as "Taxila" university, 
named after the city where it was situated. The king and rich people of the 
region used to donate lavishly for the development of the university. In the 
religious scriptures also, Taxila is mentioned as the place where the king of 
snakes, Vasuki selected Taxila for the dissemination of knowledge on earth.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Here it would be essential to mention briefly the 
range of subjects taught in the university of Taxila.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(1) Science,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(2) Philosophy,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(3) Ayurveda,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(4) Grammar of various languages,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(5) Mathematics,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(6) Economics,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(7) Astrology,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(8) Geography,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(9) Astronomy,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(10) Surgical science,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">(11) Agricultural sciences, (12) Archery and Ancient 
and Modern Sciences.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The university also used to conduct researches on 
various subjects.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Commotion in Taxila</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Gandhar Republic was not able to come out of the shock 
of the comprehensive defeat at the hands of the province of Porus, when a new 
contingency starred in the eyes of Taxila. Thousands of refugees poured in 
Taxila as a result of the widespread attacks of the armies of Alexander. These 
people were not productive for the state as they didn't come to Taxila to 
acquire knowledge or in search of jobs. They didn't have money or any kind of 
assets to buy themselves the essential commodities. To resolve the problem, a 
meeting was convened by the rulers of the neighboring countries and the king of 
Taxila. The knowledgeable people who gathered to give their opinions on the 
problem faced by Taxila, gave out their suggestions. At the end of the meeting, 
it was decided that the refugees must be given cover under humanitarian grounds. 
So, in line with the decision taken, a stretch of land outside Taxila was 
allotted for the refugees. They were allowed to enter Taxila after proving their 
identity with the sentry. In this way what appeared to be a calamity was 
appeased without</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">much ado. The incident was just a precursor to a 
series of events which reverberated across India as a result of the attacks of 
Alexander.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Move towards Patliputra</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Though Chanakya was just a professor in the Taxila 
University which seemed to be far away from the happenings in the country, he 
actually was able to influence the governments in a big way. His students looked 
at him as an ideal teacher who inspired and exemplified great knowledge. His 
students respected him and were ready to fight at any moment at his orders. Two 
of his students who have been mentioned at various instances were Bhadrabhatt 
and Purushdutt. In the events that unfolded in the life of Chanakya, these two 
played a pivotal role in the achievement of his goals. It is rumored that they 
acted as spies for Chanakya, collecting information about his enemies.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Somehow, Chanakya came to know that there was a chance 
of foreign invasion. Europe’s great warrior Salukes was readying his armies to 
attack the weakened republics of India. There were grave designs threatening the 
unity and integrity of the nation. In such a scenario the ruler of Patliputra, 
Mahanand was squeezing the common man of his wealth with an object of enriching 
his own exchequer. Chanakya was aware of the internal and external threats of 
the country. On the one hand, the rulers of the neighboring countries were 
looking for the slightest of chance to annex the prosperous regions of the 
country and on the other hand, foreign invaders started moving towards the 
country with an expectation of easily smothering the country. These thoughts 
gave Chanakya sleepless nights. He envisioned his country clutched in the chains 
of slavery and defeated because of internal squabbles and differences. So he 
decided on the historical day, thus saying,</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">"Now the time has come to leave the university. The 
scrupulous rulers of the country must be uprooted and there is a need to 
strengthen the country politically and economically. My first and foremost duty 
is to save the country of the foreign invaders and salvage this dangerous 
proposition."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">With these thoughts in mind, he left Taxila University 
for Patliputra which paved the way for watershed changes in the politics of 
India and Patliputra.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Patliputra – The city of fortunes</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Patliputra, (presently known as Patna) has been 
historically a very important city politically and strategically. Like Delhi, 
Patliputra has seen the ups and downs of development and great reversals. The 
well known Chinese traveler Fahian, who visited the city in 399 BC described it 
as prosperous city endowed with rich natural resources. At the same time, 
another Chinese traveler Huen sang described it as a city of rubbles and ruins.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Shishunagvanshi established the city on the southern 
bank of the Ganges. It was addressed with different names at different times. 
To. illustrate a few names, Pushpapur, Pushpanagar, Patliputra and Patna.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The city was industrious in producing essential 
commodities and luxurious goods for the rich. When Chanakya entered the city, it 
was known for respecting knowledgeable people and scholars. The intellectuals 
from across the country were warmly invited for the intercourse of new ideas and 
development of the state. It was virtually the city of fortunes as it recognized 
the true talent and rewarded richly for the work done by an individual. No 
wonder Chanakya decided to start his glorious campaign from Patliputra.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>"I will destroy you"</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Dhanananda, the ruler of Patliputra was unscrupulous 
and cruel by nature. He was always busy gathering money without thinking about 
consequences. He was always dissatisfied with the amount of money he had. 
Collecting taxes exorbitantly, he was a villain in the public eye. There was 
public outrage on the taxes which were collected on unwanted things. The main 
aim of collecting taxes was to serve the selfish interests of the king. There 
were taxes on hides, tax on wood and tax even on stone! The amount of money 
which Dhanananda had was unimaginable.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">When Chanakya arrived at Patliputra, there was a 
change in the way he ran his kingdom. He gave gifts to the poor and was on the 
way of becoming lenient in administration. He had formed a trust or committee to 
administer his gifts and charities. The committee was headed by scholars and 
influential people of the society. It is said that the president had the powers 
to make up to ten million gold coins.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Since Chanakya was a great scholar from Taxila, he was 
included in the committee for charity. Chanakya later on became the president of 
the ‘Sungha’ (Trust). The Sungha used to help the king in the distribution of 
the money allotted for charity to the different sections of the society. In the 
process of delegation of the funds for charity, the president of the trust had 
to meet the king frequently. When Chanakya met the king for the first time, he 
was disgusted at the ugly appearance of Chanakya. As time passed he developed 
contempt for Chanakya. There was no refinement in words and conduct. To increase 
the fire between Dhanananda and Chanakya, the courtiers dissuaded the king from 
having a cordial relationship with Chanakya. Chanakya acted like a thorough 
professional and avoided praising the king. He always spoke bluntly and tersely. 
The king did not like the way Chanakya behaved with him. The king removed 
Chanakya from the post of president without any reasons. Chanakya was enraged at 
the proposition of being exploited by the less knowledgeable king. So, he 
erupted like a volcano on the king, and said, " Arrogance in you has eroded the 
respect which I had for you. You have removed me from the presidentship for no 
fault of mine. You can’t act in a way detrimental to the demeanor of a king. You 
think there is none to question you? You have removed me from my rightful place 
and I will dethrone you !"</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Chanakya meets Chandragupta</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Just after getting humiliated from the king, Chanakya 
scampered through the streets of Patliputra. In a hurried walk, he stumbled upon 
a stump of grass and was about to fall. Chanakya the great scholar had his own 
style of handling things. He looked at the roots of the grass and quickly got 
into action. Though he was angry, he never let his anger to get out of control. 
He directed the anger in the right direction. Calmly, he sat down in the burning 
sun, removed that grass from the roots from the earth. After making sure that 
not even a single strand of grass is left, he resumed his journey.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">While Chanakya was engrossed in removing the grass 
from the ground, a young man was closely watching the act of Chanakya. The young 
man was Chandragupta, the would be emperor of the Mauryan Empire. He looked 
bright. Looking at the determination of Chanakya, he was impressed and wanted to 
talk to the knowledgeable man.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">He went to Chanakya, addressed him respectfully, and 
took him into the choultry. Chanakya asked him about his family background 
beginning his talk by asking, "Who are you? You seem to be worried."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The young man stepped forward with great reverence and 
said, "Sir, my name is Chandragupta. Yes, you are correct I am in great trouble 
but should I trouble you with my worries?"</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Chanakya calmed down the young man by saying, "You can 
tell me about your troubles with freewill and without any ambiguities. If I am 
capable enough, I’ll definitely help you."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">"I am the grandson of king Sarvarthasiddhi, He had two 
wives, Sunandadevi and Muradevi. Sunanda got nine sons called the Navanandas. 
Mura, had only one which was my father. The Nandas tried to kill my father time 
and again. We were more than hundred brothers. The Nandas out of jealousy, tried 
to kill all of us. Somehow I survived and I am totally disgusted with my life. I 
want to take revenge on the Nandas who are ruling over the country presently."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Chanakya who was freshly wounded by the Nandas found a 
companion to destroy the distraught king. Chanakya was greatly moved by the tale 
of woe. He was emotionally charged listening to the story of Chandragupta and 
vowed to destroy the Nandas and get Chandragupta his rightful place as a king of 
Patliputra. Chanakya said "I will get you the kingship, Chandragupta. From that 
day on Chanakya and Chandragupta worked in tandem to destroy the corrupt and 
unscrupulous rule of the Nandas.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Chandragupta has not been well documented. The place 
of birth, family background and several details regarding his life are not 
available. Several things have been said and written about his family and 
parents. Probably, he belonged to the Moria community. He might have got the 
name Chandragupta Maurya afterwards and his royal lineage was known as the 
Maurya dynasty. His mother was perhaps the daughter of a village headman. His 
father was the king of a forest area called Pippatavana, who died in a war. 
Chandragupta came to Patliputra along with his mother.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">As a boy Chandragupta was a born leader. Even as a 
boy, he was accepted as a leader by all. As a boy he used to mimic the king’ 
court. His bravery and shrewdness were visible right from childhood. As Chanakya 
was moving along the streets of Patliputra, he saw little Chandragupta enacting 
the king. Sitting on the large throne, the little boy shouted against injustice 
and corrupt practices of the kings and people in general. Looking at the bright 
face of Chandragupta, he was impressed at the intellect and wisdom in the boy’s 
voice. For seven or eight years Chandragupta had his education there, and that 
too with selected teachers shortlisted by Chanakya himself. The art of warfare 
and the art of governance were mastered by Chandragupta with equal expertise.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>The Greek invader</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The relationship between Chandragupta and Chanakya 
bloomed through the years developing into a strong force for their enemies. Most 
of the historical events took place right under the eyes of Chanakya and 
Chandragupta. The troops of Alexander and the umpteen number of invaders who 
ravaged the subcontinent for decades around India. It is said that Chandragupta 
met Alexander. The bold and arrogant talk by Chandragupta enraged Alexander as a 
result of which Chandragupta was arrested. Chanakya’s training to Chandragupta 
was over by now and he thought it to be the right occasion to let Chandragupta 
taste the practical aspect of warfare. Chanakya closely observed the movement 
and strategies employed by Alexander. He also became aware of the weaknesses of 
the Indian rulers.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Freedom from the Greeks</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The rustic boy that Chandragupta was, now had matured 
into a sound military commander. The source of strength for Chandragupta and his 
army was the power of mind and the towering personality of Chanakya. In that war 
of independence for northern India, Chandragupta was the physical instrument, 
while its thinking brain was Chanakya.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The deterioration of the prowess of Alexander happened 
because of the weakening of Satraps or the commanding officers. Niccosar, a 
Satrap was killed even when Alexander was alive. Another formidable Satrap 
called Philip, was killed weakening Alexander like never before. After 
Alexander’s death in Babylon, all his Satraps were either killed or dislodged , 
one by one. Alexander’s lieutenants divided his empire among themselves in 321 
BC. No realm east of the Indus – the River Sindhu was mentioned in that 
settlement. It meant that the Greeks themselves had accepted that this region 
had gone out of their rule.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>Defeat of the Nanda king</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Before defeating the Nandas, Chanakya had to employ 
various strategies before victory. Chanakya firstly tested the policy of 
attacking the core of the city. The policy met with defeats again and again. 
With the change in strategy, Chanakya and Chandragupta began the attack on the 
borders of the Magadha Empire. Again there were mistakes. The troops were not 
stationed in the areas conquered. So when they marched forward, the people of 
the conquered areas joined together again and encircled their army. Thus those 
who had been defeated had to be fought again and again</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Chandragupta and Chanakya learnt lessons from these 
mistakes. They now stationed troops in the conquered regions. So those enemies 
would not raise and cause any trouble. Chanakya with his cleverness had earlier 
won the friendship of king Parvataka (or Porus Second). Now Parvataka, his 
brother Vairochaka and son Malayeketu came with their armies to help them. The 
Nanda king had the support of a big army. The other equally important support 
was the guidance of his very able minister, Amatya Rakshasa. This minister was 
very intelligent and had unlimited loyalty to the king. Chanakya knew that 
getting Amatya out of his way was the only way of defeating King Nanda. Chanakya 
devised a plan which involved planting of spies in the enemy camp. In a very 
short span of time, the weaknesses of the Nandas became visible. Parallely, the 
Nandas and Amatya Rakshasa made plans to counter any attacks by Chanakya.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">Details are not available regarding the war between 
the Nandas on the one hand and Chandragupta and Chanakya on the other. But it 
was a keen and bitter fight. The Nanda king died. His sons and relatives also 
died. Even Amatya Rakshasa was helpless. Chandragupta was victorious proving the 
foresight of Chanakya regarding his abilities. The old king and his wife retired 
to the forest. It is said that after sometime Chanakya had the old king and his 
wife killed , because he thought that if Amatya Rakshasa made them take a son by 
the rights of adoption, there would be claimants to the throne. He wanted the 
lineage of the Nandas should be totally eliminated.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style5"><strong>The true aspect of Chanakya</strong></span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The momentous life of Chanakya reminds us of a 
revengeful saga where the individual is obsessed by the idea of taking revenge. 
But personal revenge was not the aim of Chanakya. He wanted that the kingdom 
should be secure and that the administration should go on smoothly, bringing 
happiness to the people. He thought that there were two ways of ensuring the 
happiness of the people. Firstly, Amatya Rakshasa had to be made Chandragupta’s 
minister; Secondly, a book must be written, laying down how a king should 
conduct himself, how he should protect himself and the kingdom from the enemies, 
how to ensure law and order, and so on.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">By writing "Arthashastra" and "Nitishastra", Chanakya 
has become a</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">never ending phenomena. He has truly guided the 
generations with his</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">wisdom . It would ideally suit the closing of the life 
of Chanakya with a</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">couple of quotations by Chanakya</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">"The secret task of a king is to strive for the 
welfare of his people incessantly.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">The administration of the kingdom is his religious 
duty. His greatest gift would</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">be to treat all as equals."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">"The happiness of the commoners is the happiness of 
the king. Their</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">welfare is his welfare. A king should never think of 
his personal interest</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">or welfare, but should try to find his joy in the joy 
of his subjects."</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">These words were written 2300 years ago by Chanakya, 
the expert</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">statesman and wise sage. And Chanakya is also another 
name for</span><br class="auto-style2" />
<span class="auto-style2">courage and perseverance.</span><br class="auto-style2" />
